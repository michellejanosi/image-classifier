# Transfer Learning Image Classifier ðŸ–¼

A simple custom image classifier that is trained on the fly in the browser using TensorFlow.js and MobileNet, a pre-trained model, for image classification. 

## Functions

* Load pretrained MobileNet model and make a prediction on new data.
* Make predictions through the webcam.
* Use intermediate activations of MobileNet to do transfer learning on a new set of classes you define on the fly with the webcam.

## Built With

* [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) - The machine learning library used
* [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet) - Pretrained model
